**Problem Statement**

Many beginners learning Python find it hard to locate small but engaging projects that allow them to practice loops, conditionals, input handling, and basic game logic. The classic Hangman game provides an excellent challenge. Players must guess letters to uncover a hidden word while avoiding wrong guesses that decrease their remaining lives.

This project aims to create a simple, interactive, console-based Hangman game. It will demonstrate fundamental programming concepts and offer an enjoyable user experience.

**Scope of the Project**

The scope of this project includes:

- Designing a console-based Hangman game using Python.
- Implementing a word selection system with a predefined list of words.
- Displaying ASCII hangman art based on the number of lives left.
- Handling user input with validation to prevent invalid or repeated guesses.
- Providing win or lose conditions and revealing the correct word at the end.
- Ensuring the game runs in any Python-supported environment such as Windows, macOS, or Linux.

Out of scope (not included at this stage):

- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Multiplayer mode
- Score tracking or databases
- Difficulty levels or hints (unless added later)

**Target Users**

This project is designed for:

1. Beginner Python Developers
   - Looking for a practice project to improve programming fundamentals.
   - Wanting to understand loops, conditions, input/output, and ASCII art.

2. Students & Learners
   - Completing assignments or learning game logic in Python courses.
   - Experimenting with small terminal-based applications.

3. Casual Players
   - Anyone who enjoys simple word-guessing games.
   - Users wanting a nostalgic version of Hangman that can be played in the terminal.

**High-Level Features**

The Hangman game includes the following major features:

- Random Word Selection  
  The game picks a word at random from a large list to ensure replayability.

- ASCII-Based Hangman Graphics  
  A progressive drawing of the hangman figure depending on remaining lives.

- Input Validation  
  Accepts only single alphabetic characters.  
  Rejects repeated guesses.  
  Converts inputs to lowercase for consistency.

- Lives & Feedback System  
  Heart-based “lives” display.  
  Immediate feedback on correct or incorrect guesses.  
  Shows all guessed letters.

- Win/Loss Detection  
  Displays a winning message when the word is fully guessed.  
  Shows the complete hangman and reveals the word when the player loses.

- A system architecture diagram  
- A full documentation folder structure  
- A test plan or test cases document
